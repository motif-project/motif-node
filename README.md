# BitDSM Node Setup Guide 🧪 ⚙️

## 1. Overview
The architecture includes the following components:
- **Event Manager**: A thread which registers to the events of `BitDSM` AVS contract.
- **Deposit Checker**: A thread which confirms the BTC deposit form a BTC node . 
- **Api Server**: An API server to create new multisig addresses and PSBTs. 
- **bitcoind Offline Wallet**: An offline server that hosts a single wallet containing a signer BTC key. This server is used to sign PSBT transactions forwarded by the `API server`.
- **Signet Node**: A `BTC` full `Signet` node with txindexing enabled, used to watch addresses, create transactions and broadcast them. 


**For a production environment, it is highly recommended to deploy the bitcoind Offline Wallet and the nyks Full Node/btc-oracle on separate hosts**.

The btc-oracle offline signer design is based on remote signing available in `bitcoind` and `lnd`. Signer mode, however, does not require a BTC full node connection as the signer is not responsible for creating or broadcasting transactions.

## 2. BTC offline wallet setup

We recommend using an instance of [bitcoin-core] (https://bitcoin.org/en/releases/27.0/) configured in the Offline signing wallet mode.The Bitcoin Core wallet is the preferred choice because it enables clients to utilize external signers and boasts a long-standing, rigorously tested codebase.

For ensuring wallet security, it is strongly recommended to use a separate host system with atleast 4 GB RAM and 2 GB available storage space. The system should be completely disconnected from all public networks (internet, tor, wifi etc.). The `offline` wallet host is not required to download or synchronize blockchain data.

The offline wallet should be setup as a server as part of a secured private network where, the wallet is only accessible through a designated rpc connection with `btc-oracle`. To ensure the integrity and security of the data, only `TLS` based rpc connection should be allowed between `btc-oracle` and the offline wallet node. 

### 2.1 Installation

Download and install the bitcoin binaries according to your operating systemfrom the official [Bitcoind Core registry](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-27.0/). All programs in this guide are compatible with version `27.0`.

### 2.2 Configuration
`bitcoind` instance can be configured by using a `bitcoin.conf` file. In `Linux` based systems the file is found in `/home/<username>/.bitcoin`.

A sample configuration file with recommended settings is as follows
```shell
# Accept command line and JSON-RPC commands
server=1

# RPC server settings
rpcuser=<rpc-username>
rpcpassword=<rpc-password>
# field <userpw> comes in the format: <USERNAME>:<SALT>$<HASH>.
# rpcauth = <userpw>

# Port your bitcoin node will listen for incoming requests;
# listening for bitcoin mainnet
rpcport=8332 
# Address your bitcoin node will listen for incoming requests
# should be the address of your offline host
rpcbind=0.0.0.0
# Needed for remote node connectivity
# btc-oracle IP should only be allowed 
rpcallowip=0.0.0.0/0
# Offline Wallet server shouldn't connect to any external p2p or chain node
connect=0
```

JSON-RPC connection authentication can be configured to use `rpc-username`:`rpc-password` pair or a `username and HMAC-SHA-256 hashed password` through rpcauth option. It is not recommended to hardcode `rpc-password` in the config file. The salted hash can be created from canonical python script included in the share/rpcauth in bitcoin-core installed directory. 

### 2.3. Run the RPC Server 

By default, the `bitcoind` server can be run using the following command.
```shell
bitcoind
```
In case, a non-default home directory was used during installation:

```shell
bitcoind -datadir=/path/to/bitcoin/home
```
### 2.3. Manage Wallet 

The following commands shall be used to create and manage BTC wallet on the offline host. The wallet will contain a single address controlled by a private key that will be used to sign transactions recieved from `btc-oracle`

1. Create the wallet
    ```shell
    bitcoin-cli -named createwallet \
        wallet_name=<wallet_name> \
        passphrase=<passphrase> \
        load_on_startup=true \
    ```
    Flags explanation:
    - `wallet_name`: The name of the wallet
    - `passphrase`: The passphrase that will be used to encrypt the `wallet.dat` file. 
    - `load_on_startup=true`: Ensures that the wallet is automatically loaded in
      case of `bitcoind` server restart

2. Create a new address
    ```shell
    bitcoin-cli getnewaddress
    ```
    Save the address for future use. This address shall be used to recieve/send funds on the BTC chain. 

3. Obtain 33-byte BTC public key derived from the above address
    ```shell
    bitcoin-cli getaddressinfo <btc_address> | jq -r .pubkey
    ```
    Maintain a record of the public key in its hexadecimal string fromat. The btc public key will be used during the signer registration process when setting up the `btc-oracle` to act as Fragment `Signer`.  

4. The wallet can be unlocked on the offline host using the following command
    ```shell
      bitcoin-cli walletpassphrase <passphrase> <unlock_time>
    ```
    where:
    - `passphrase` is the same as when used for creating the wallet and,
    - `unlock_time` is the amount of time the wallet is unlocked for in seconds

5. The wallet can be backedup and restored 
    ```shell
      # Backup the wallet
      bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=<wallet-name> backupwallet /path/to/backup/wallet.dat
      # Restore the wallet
      bitcoin-cli restorewallet <wallet-name> /path/to/backup/wallet.dat
    ```
    It is recommended to take periodic backups of the wallet to keep it secure.

### 3.5. Contract addresses
The contract addresses for the deployed contracts are available on the [BitDSM repo.](https://github.com/BitDSM/BitDSM/blob/implement-v1-ecdsa/README.md#existing-holesky-testnet-deployment) 


## 4. Eth Wallet Setup
The System Uses the go-ethereum library's keystore save keys. if there is no keystore file in the directory (mentioned in config file) the system will generate a new key and save it in a newly created keystore located at the mentioned directory encrypted with the password mentioned in config file. 

If you have a Private key you want to use specifically, you can use the code snippet below to create a keystore before you run BitDSM Operator.

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/accounts/keystore"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/crypto"
)

func main() {
	if len(os.Args) != 3 {
		fmt.Println("Usage: go run main.go <private_key_hex> <password>")
		return
	}

	privateKeyHex := os.Args[1]
	password := os.Args[2]

	// Decode the private key from hex
	privateKeyBytes, err := hex.DecodeString(privateKeyHex)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to decode private key: %v", err)
	}

	// Convert the private key bytes to an ECDSA private key
	privateKey, err := crypto.ToECDSA(privateKeyBytes)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to convert private key: %v", err)
	}

	// Create a keystore
	ks := keystore.NewKeyStore("keystore", keystore.StandardScryptN, keystore.StandardScryptP)

	// Create a new account with the private key
	account, err := ks.ImportECDSA(privateKey, password)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to import private key to keystore: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Keystore created: %s\n", account.Address.Hex())
}
```

## 5. Run the Operator

### 5.1. Install Golang
To run the operator, you will first have to install [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)

### 5.2. Build and Runthe Operator
To run the operator run the following commands from root

```shell
go mod tidy 
go build .
go run main.go
```

This will start all the components of the operator. It is ideal to run it inside a process manager like `systemd` or `tmux` to ensure that the operator is running continuously. 


## 6. API Server
The API server is used to create new multisig addresses and PSBTs. It is a simple HTTP server that listens on port 8080. 

### 6.1. Create a new multisig address
- `Endpoint`: /eigen/get_address
- `Method`: POST
- `Description`: It is a POST operation that returns a new multisig generated using the provided pubkey and the pubkey of the operator.
- `Body` :
```json
{
    "pubKey":"",
    "podEthAddr":""
}
```

### 6.3. Get Node Information
- `Endpoint`: /eigen/node
- `Method`: GET
- `Description`: Retrieves information about the node.

### 6.4. Health Check
- `Endpoint`: /eigen/node/health
- `Method`: GET
- `Description`: Checks the health status of the node.

### 6.5. Get Services
- `Endpoint`: /eigen/node/services
- `Method`: GET
- `Description`: Retrieves a list of services running on the node.

### 6.6. Get Service Health
- `Endpoint`: /eigen/node/services/{service_ID}/health
- `Method`: GET
- `Description`: Checks the health status of a specific service identified by service_ID.


## 7. DataBase Setup
We use Postgres DB. Once the DB is installed you can run the .db/schema.sql file to create the tables.
